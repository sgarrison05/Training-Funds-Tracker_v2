Use the form to enter in transactions.  It gives a preview of the entry and submits it to the bank file.
The bank file is a simple text file that looks like a check register. The main form has the ability to reconcile 
the current training and start a new one.  Each training will be reconciled into it's own folder for readability 
and simplicity.
